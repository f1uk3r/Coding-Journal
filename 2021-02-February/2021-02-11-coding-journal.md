# Keyword Research

## Types of keyword research

1. Short tail keyword: usually high search volume, high competition, also lower conversion. Not specific, less than 3 words. Since, these keywords are broad match, they don't convert very well. 
2. Long tail keyword: lower search volume, low competition, but conversion could he higher. Very specific, more than 3 words. This will bring in quality traffic leading to higher conversion rate

Keyword research is done based on the following factor 

- Search volume: It indicates the potential traffic you can obtain
- Competition: High/Medium/Low. Or we can search `allintitle: pizza recipes` to find the competition for that keyword
- Relevancy: It's more intuitive to your business to drive more quality traffic.
- Commercial intent: These keywords drive more conversions and revenue for the business
