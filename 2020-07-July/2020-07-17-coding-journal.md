Whenever thinking of using vuex in vuejs or nuxtjs for login authentication with django rest framework, do give these two articles a read. They are worth it

[Part 1](https://hackernoon.com/jwt-authentication-in-vue-js-and-django-rest-framework-part-1-c40c5c0d4f6e)

[Part 2](https://medium.com/hackernoon/jwt-authentication-in-vue-js-and-django-rest-framework-part-2-788f0ad53ad5)

This is again a very good [article on nuxt + vuex](https://itnext.io/efficiently-understanding-and-using-nuxt-vuex-7905eb8858d6) but i have mentioned this before as well
