Python: Functional Programming. [Official Doc](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)

- **Procedural** languages --> programs are list of instructions that tell the computer what to do with the program's input. 

- **Declarative** languages --> we write a specification that describes the problem to be solved and the language implementation figures out how to perform the computation efficiently. SQL is a declaritive language. A SQL query describes the data set we want to retrieve and the SQL engine decides whether to scan tables or use indexes, which subclauses should be performed first

- **Object-oriented** languages --> programs manipulate collections of objects. Objects have internal state and  upport methods that query or modify this internal state in some ways. 

- **Functional** languages --> program decomposes a problem into a set of function. Ideally, function only take input and produce outputs and don't have any internal state that affects the output produced for a given input.
