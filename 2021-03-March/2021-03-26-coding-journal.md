# Why Links are important for SEO

[Article](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/why-links-important-seo/)

- *Internal links* are links between the pages within your own website
- *Inbound links* are links that come from other websites or a different domain name
- *Outbound links* are those links on your website that link out to websites with a different domain name.

Out of the three types of links, inbound links are the ones with the greatest SEO benefit, but they are also hardest to obtain.

The more links a page gets, the more votes they are getting, which can improve their ranking. However, the quantity of links that a page gets is not all that matters. Google also evaluates the quality of the links.

Links serve as a reflection of the quality of a page's content as long as they are natural links. The Penguin update made it easier for Google to identify artificial links.

It is highly unlikely that a lot of people will use exactly the same anchor text. If you keep optimizing for the same anchor text when trying to gain links from other sites and it starts to become the majority anchor text and it is not your brand name, this is highly unnatural. It is important to see some diversity in anchor text, even including generic anchor text like click here, visit here, website, etc.
