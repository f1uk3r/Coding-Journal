## Make sure your keywords are Relevant

- One way to determine keyword relevance is to examine the top-ranking sites and see what keywords they are using in their page title and meta description

- Another way is to perform a competitor analysis of the top-ranking sites in your niche. There are many tools that can help you identify how sites are using keyword on-page.

## Make sure that pages on your site can be reached by a link from another findable page

Google recommends that all pages on your site have atleast one link from another page.

Links should also be crawlable. Making your links crawlable ensures a great user experience and that Google can easily crawl and understand your website.

## Limit the Quantity of Links on a Page to a reasonable number

Google's guidelines now state that you can have a few thousand (at most) on a page. It's reasonable to assume that Google uses quantities of links as a spam signal.

John Mueller has stated that they don't care about internal links, and you can do what you want.

## Use the robots.txt file to manage your craww budget

Crawl Budget optimization is an important part of making sure that Google can crawl your site efficiently and easily. 

You optimize your crawl budget in two ways - the links on your site and robots.txt

[This guide from Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7424835) tells you everything you need to know about the robots.txt and how it impacts crawling.

## Design your site to have a clear conceptual page hierarchy

This means your site is organised by topical relevance.

You have the main topics of your site arranged as main topics, with subtopics arranged underneath the main topics. These are called SEO silos. SEO Silos are a great way to organize the pages on your site according to topics.

The deeper the clear conceptual page hierarchy, the better. This tells Google that your site is knowledgeable about the topic.

## Ensure all website assets are fully crawlable & indexable

To see which assets that Googlebot cannot crawl, use the URL inspection tool, to debug directives in your robots.txt file, use the robots.txt tester tool
