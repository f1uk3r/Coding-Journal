# Article: History of SEO. [Link](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/seo-history/)

- Term SEO can be traced back as early as Feb 1997
- Initially it was very directory driven. LookSmart, Yahoo Directory, DMOZ were early Directory projects.
- Before SEO became the official name, other terms were used as well, e.g., Search engine placement, Search engine positioning, search engine ranking, search engine registration, website promotion, Search engine Marketing.
- Search Engine Marketing is still used but is now more associated with paid search marketing and advertising. The two terms co-exist peacefully today.

### Some SEO highlights from 1990s

- 1994 - Yahoo was created, originally an Internet bookmark list and directory of interesting sites. Webmasters had to manually submit their page to the Yahoo directory for indexing so that it would be there for Yahoo to find when someone performed a search. AltaVista, Excite, Lycos also launched.
- 1996 - Page and Brin built and tested Backrub, a new search engine that ranked sites based on inbound link relevancy and popularity. Backrub would ultimately become Google. HotBot also launched.
- 1997 - Danny Sullivan launched Search Engine Watch, a website dedicated to providing news about the search industry tips on searching the web, and information about how to rank websites better. AskJeeves also debuted and Google.com was registered.
- 1998 - Goto.com launched with sponsored links and paid search. Advertisers bid on Goto.com to rank above organic search results. Goto.com was ultimately acquired by Yahoo. DMOZ became the most sought after place for SEP practitioners to get their pages listed. MSN entered the space with MSN Search
- 1999 - First-ever all search marketing conference, Search Engine Strategies took place. The SES conference series continued running under various monikers and parent companies until shutting down in 2016

## The Google Revolution

In 2000, Yahoo partnered with Google and let Google power their organic results instead of Inktomi. Beforehand, Google was a little-known search engine. Now, every Yahoo search result said "Powered by Google" and they ended up introducing their largest competitor to the world and Google became a household name.

Until this point, search engines mainly ranked sites based on the on-page content, domain names, ability to get listed in the aforementioned directories and basic side struture. But Google's web crawler and PageRank algorithm were revolutionary for information retrieval.

Google looked at both on-page and off-page factors - the quantity and quality of external links pointing to a website. Google's algorithm was essentially about "if people are talking about you, you must be important."

Although links were only one component of Google's overall ranking algorithm, SEO practitioners latched onto links as being the most important factor and an entire industry of `link building` was created.

Over the next decate, it became a race to acquire as many links as possible in the hopes of ranking higher. Links became heavily abused tactic that Google would have to address in coming years, This ushered in an era of unsolicited link exchange request email. 

In 2000 Google also launched AdWords, and paid search ads began appearing above, below, and to the right of Google's unpaid results.

Over the coming months and years, the SEO world got used to a monthly Google Dance, or a period of time during which Google updated its index, sometimes resulting in major ranking fluctuations.

SEO got a lot harder following updates because it became much more important than just repeating keywords x amount of times. 

In 2003 after acquiring bloggers.com, Google launched AdSense which serves contextually targeted Google ads on publishing sites. The mix of AdSense and Blogger.com let to a surge in simple, monetized online publishing and a blogging revolution.

Around 2004, Google and other top search engines started improving results for queries that had geographic intent. 

Around 2004, Google and search engines started making greater use of end-user data like search history and interest to personalise search results.

In 2005, nofollow tags were created as a means to combat spam.

In 2006, Google rolled out a Maps Plus Box.

## Youtube, Google Analytics & Webmaster Tools

In 2006, Google acquired Youtube which ultimately became the second most used search property in the world. Due to its soaring popularity video SEO became crucial for brands, businesses and individuals that wanted to be found.

In 2006, Google launched Google Analytics which is a free, web-based tool which became instant success

In 2006, Google Webmaster Tools (now Search Console) was also launched, it let webmasters view crawling errors, see what searches your site showed up for, and request re-inclusion.

Also in 2006, XML sitemaps gained universal support from the search engines. XML sitemaps allows webmasterrrs to display to the search engines, every URL on their website that is available for crawling. An XML sitemap contains not only a list of URLs but a range of further information, which helped search engines to crawl more intelligently.

## Universal Search

Untill this point, the search results had consisted of 10 blue links. 

Then Google began blending traditional organic search results with other types of vertical results like news, video and images. 

## Cleaning up the Cesspool

In 2008, then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt said the internet was becoming a cesspool and that brands were the solution. After few months Google came up with a update resulted in big brands suddenly ranking a whole lot better in the SERPs.

According to google, they weren't trying to reward brands but putting greater weight on trust in the algorithm, and big brands tend to have more trust than smaller and less-established brands. 

In 2010, Google announced that site speed was a ranking factor.

## The Rise of Social Media 

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn all emerged as major players. Along with the rise of social media came speculation that social signals can impact search rankings. 

Social media can help SEO but indirectly - just as other forms of marketing can help drive more traffic to your website and increase brand awareness and affinity. While the impact of social shares has been denied time and again by Google through the years as being a ranking factor, it continued to be listed as having a strong correlation in various ranking factor studies.

## Schema

Schema markup, a form of microdata, was introduced in 2011 to help search engines interpret the context of the query. Schema is not a ranking factor. However, schema does help you stand out in the SERPs with rich and featured snippets.

For eg, in a Search Engine Journal webinar, Milestone shared they saw a 33-66% boost in search impression for a large fast food restaurant chain locations after schema was deployed. Another experiment by InLinks revealed that sites with schema gained ranking once schema was implemented.

## Mobile-First

In 2015, mobile searches overtook desktop search for the first time on Google. In 2015, Google launched mobile-friendly algorithm update, designed to give users "the most relevant and timely results, whether the information is on mobile-friendly web pages or in a mobile app"

In an attempt to speed up pages, Google also introduced Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) in 2016, the idea behind AMP was to instantly load content.
In 2017 Google announced that page speed will now be a ranking factor for mobile searches. In same month, Google stated it will begin to devalue pages with intrusive pop-ups. In July 2019, mobile-fiest indexing was enabled for all new websites. And, by March 2021, all websites will have switched to mobile-first indexing.

## Featured Snippets

Featured snippets are short text, bullet points, numbers, or tables that appear at the top of a Google's search. The goal of a featured snippet is to answer the searcher's query directly in the SERPs without needing to click through the website. 

In June 2020, Google released an update stating that featured snippets will now take users directly to the text that is relevant to their search query. 


# Article: What is SEO & How it works [Links](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/what-is-seo/)

SEO is the process of making your site rank as high as possible in Google for a particular keyword you want to target. The higher your site ranks, the more visible your business is and the more traffic and sales your business is likely to generate

# Relevant, Optimized Content wins every time.

Backbone of SEO is high-quality, optimized content. 

- Keywords are still critical, but context matters more. Google crawlers now analyze the context and look for related secondary keywords that share the searcher's intent
- Include clear, keyword-rich titles, meta descriptions, alt attributes, H1 tags and URLs. These factors tell Google that your site is relevant and helps it rank
- Length matters, but relevance matters more. Google says: "The amount of content necessary for the page to be satisfying depends on the topic and purpose of the page".

# Metadata Matters

Metadata is the title and lines of text that show up on the search result page. Metadata tells the user what they can expect to find if they click on the page.

- include relevant but not repetitive, keywords and variation in the title and description.
- be clear and concise, so users know what to expect.

Think of metadata as ads for your content. Why should users click? What can you tell them?

# Links matter

Links work as 'votes' telling Google that other sites think your content is useful and relevant. The more high-quality, relevant links you acquire, the higher your site will likely rank for related key terms.

But, quality matters more than quantity. If you invest in link building as part of your SEO efforts, target links from high-authority, high-traffic websites.

# User Experience (UX) Impact Rating

UX plays a substantial role in how well your website will rank on Google. However, UX depends on a ton of factors like site infrastructure and layout, content and so forth, making it hard to measure. If youuant to win at SEO, UX should be a top priority.

- Ensure time on page and CTR are high, and the bounce rate is low. These signals are not direct ranking factors but optimizing your site for high engagement can help indirectly.
- Make your site easy to navigate. 
- Site speed matters a lot. In an ideal world, your site should load in less than 2 seconds. Image compression, code and structure optimizations and faster servers will help. Start with Google's [PageSpeed Insight tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to see where you stand.

As Google becomes smarter, UX is likely to play an even more important role in the future. 

# Mobile matters more than ever before

In 2018, Google moved to mobile-first indexing, which means the search engine uses mobile versions of your site to rank your sites in their results.

Google suggests investing in responsive design. You need to make your content consistent across desktop and mobile devices and ensure the site loads fast on both mobile and desktop.

# Don't ignore voice search

Voice search has been growing in popularity and will likely continue to do so. It shouldn't be our #1 SEO priority, but it does make sense to start optimizing for voice search.
